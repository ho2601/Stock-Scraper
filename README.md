Web Scraping also goes by names such as Web data extraction, screen scraping or web harvesting. <br>
This is an automated process used to extract information/data from a website which can later to used for something else.

My program is a Python script which web scapes Yahoo Finance for data (such as percentage increase, price increase etc...) related to the stocks. I also export the information into a CSV format so that the data may be analysed in other ways.
